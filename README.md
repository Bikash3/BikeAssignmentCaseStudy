## General Information
A bike-sharing company in the US, has recently experienced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is struggling to sustain itself in the current market conditions. Therefore, it has decided to develop a strategic business plan to accelerate its revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy returns to a healthy state.

The company's primary goals are:

- To understand the demand for shared bikes after the nationwide quarantine ends by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables that affect their revenues, i.e., which factors are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To assess the accuracy of the model in describing bike demands.

This plan aims to prepare BoomBikes to meet the needs of people once the situation improves, differentiate itself from other service providers, and achieve significant profits.

## Conclusions
The analysis highlights the significant impact of various categorical and numerical variables on bike rental demand. The model validation steps ensured the reliability and accuracy of the predictions. Key factors like season, month, weather conditions, and temperature play crucial roles in determining bike rentals, providing valuable insights for optimizing service and improving decision-making.
